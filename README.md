# Project 3 - *YELP

**YELP* is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height. (3pt)
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints. (+5pt)
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does). (+2pt)

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

- [x] Infinite scroll for restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [x] Implement map view of restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [x] Implement the restaurant detail page. (+2pt)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- ...Add a filter where user can choose one or more categories of their choice.(Still in progress)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to use multiple segues in one View Controller?
2. Map implementation
